                    <b>Self Advancement & Promotion</b>
                    <br>
                    WBA is very supportive of both personal enrichment, through training and conferences, as well as supporting personal promotion, through sponsored speaking engagements.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Extremely high retention</b>
                    <br>
                    WBA has a seasoned team, with a very high retention rate year-over-year.  Most members of our team have worked on multiple console generations, and have drawn experience across a wide range of industries.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Advanced Analytics in the Cloud</b>
                    <br>We have a very close relationship with many Big Data organizations, including Looker, AWS, and the Apache Software Foundation.
                    <br><br>
                    In partnership with these organizations, we regularly work ahead of our contemporaries on pre-release features that change the advertising and technology landscape.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Variety</b>
                    <br>
                    Our team supports a deep cut of the games business that it enables us to regularly cycle everyone through new projects.  It’s a great way to see a cross-cut of the games business, and further buff up your experience.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Flexible work arrangements</b>
                    <br>
                    We want to support you, and that starts with providing an environment where you can do your best work.  We have a very flexible “work from home” policy, and if life changes for you down the line, we support remote work for many situations.
